# first-vite-project

Found Vite from here: [https://blog.logrocket.com/vite-vs-snowpack-a-comparison-of-frontend-build-tools/](https://blog.logrocket.com/vite-vs-snowpack-a-comparison-of-frontend-build-tools/)

Frontend build tool that is SIGNIFICANTLy faster than webpack webpack-dev-server. Uses native ES modules to handle both dev and bundle in same package.

Extremely easy to Deploy: [https://first-vite-project.netlify.app/](https://first-vite-project.netlify.app/)
